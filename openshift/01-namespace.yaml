# ============================================
# STEP 1: Namespace (Project) Definition
# ============================================
# PURPOSE: Creates an isolated environment for your application
# WHY: OpenShift uses namespaces to separate different applications/teams
# NOTE: On shared OpenShift clusters (like Developer Sandbox), you may not have
#       permission to create namespaces. In that case, use your assigned project.

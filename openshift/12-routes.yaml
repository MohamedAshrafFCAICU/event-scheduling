# ============================================
# STEP 12: OpenShift Routes
# ============================================
# PURPOSE: Exposes services externally with HTTPS URLs
# WHY ROUTES vs INGRESS:
#   - Routes are OpenShift-specific (more features than Ingress)
#   - Automatic TLS termination with edge certificates
#   - Integrated with OpenShift's router
# TLS TERMINATION: "edge" means:
#   - HTTPS terminates at the router
#   - Traffic inside cluster is HTTP (faster)
#   - Automatic redirect from HTTP to HTTPS
# URL FORMAT: <route-name>-<namespace>.apps.<cluster-domain>
# ============================================

# Frontend Route - Main application entry point
